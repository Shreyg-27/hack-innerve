## the request form
We have created a form for the user where they have the option to choose the type of waste from the given option, if they are unsure of the type of waste they can simply upload a picture and our ml model will predict the type of waste. Further the user can specify the amount of waste, time and date of pickup and choose a location of pick up directly from the given map in the form which allows user to select a location and does all things a typical Google map does, further by clicking on the 'make a request' button they can submit their requests

## about page
On clicking on the 'about' part of the navbar we are led to this page where the user will be informed more about the type of waste and the waste management process. We have implemented a rotating carousel of cards with each card specifying the type of waste and how do we reduce or recycle or reuse depending on its type.
